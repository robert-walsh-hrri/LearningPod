There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## LearningPod ##

## Learn from experts for spare change ##

## Summary ##
  We connect learners (young and old) with experts to teach classes. Learners get the benefit of our exclusive relationships with the most interesting and qualified instructors. Instructors can turn down-time and spare time into cash, while making a difference in other people's lives.

## Problem ##
  More and more parents are seeing the benefit of having small study groups in addition to remote school work. It's not always the case that the parents are experts in math, or military history.

## Solution ##
  We connect experts with time on their hands to learners, and provide a learning environment second to none. The choices of classes are up to you and yours.

## Quote from You ##
  Robert Walsh, CEO - "We're extremely excited to announce our new innovation in EdTech, LearningPod, which is a way to help all of us learn from the best teachers. I've personally taken a course in Military History from a 4 star general and a course in fencing from a two-time Olympian. Let's see who else will be joining our platform and what else we might all learn from each other!"

## How to Get Started ##
  Just point a web browser to xxx.yyy.zzz.aaa and tell it what you'd like to do!

## Customer Quote ##
  Susan A., Washington, D.C. - "We started a pod with a couple of our neighbors right as school started in August. Honestly, it's so much work to try to help the kids with their work. And I'm terrible at calculus. I was able to find John McClain, who teaches calculus at Georgetown, to work with the kids for a couple hours a week. It's been amazing!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  They say raising a child takes a village. Let's expand that village and work together!
